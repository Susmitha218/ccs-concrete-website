I can still hear their kind words and advice. The teachers are very experienced and highly qualified. I was very new to Bangalore when I joined the school. The Kannada teachers taught me how to speak fluently in Kannada and this helped me feel at home in this wonderful city. The school played an important role in my life. The influence of this school has placed me in one of the top colleges of Bangalore. I am really grateful for all that the school has done for me.

It's been 14 years of wonderful memories.I have just finished my 10th grade in ICSE.This school is surely the best with the best facility and faculty.The teacher really care and teach the students very well. You can either choose to study in the state syllabus or ICSE syllabus from 8th standard. I have studied in ICSE syllabus which is not too easy but there a lot of optional questions too in the board exam. In ICSE there is electives where I had opted for Physical education where I loved studying this wonderful subject. So finally what I would like to convey through my 14 years experience of this school and being a graduate from this school all I can say is this is best school I have ever seen. So if you are searching for the best school in and around vidyaranyapura then it is surely "The Regency Public School." Thank you soo much Regency for everything and making my life a beautiful one. I can never forget what you have done to me. So keep growing. I am always proud of you and will always be a proud Regencian. I can probably write a book thanking my school for everything that it has given me. So I would conclude by saying that I am very much proud to be a part of Regencians family.Keep growing and once again a very big thank you for everything!!!    </p></div>          </div> -->
